# üîç Security & Sanity Audit Report

## Audit Date: 2025-08-26

### ‚ùå CRITICAL FINDINGS

1. **FALSE CLAIMS IN README**
   - **Docker Deployment**: README promises Docker deployment but NO Dockerfile exists
   - **Contributing Guide**: References `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` which doesn't exist
   - **Testing Framework**: Commands use `pytest` but it's not in requirements.txt

2. **COMMAND INCONSISTENCIES**
   - README says `python` but system needs `python3`
   - API server command doesn't properly handle HTTP server mode

3. **MISSING DEPENDENCIES**
   - `pytest` not in requirements.txt but testing section uses it
   - No verification that all imports in code are in requirements

### ‚ö†Ô∏è MODERATE ISSUES

1. **API Response Format**
   - README shows specific JSON but actual API might differ
   - No validation that the shown format matches actual output

2. **Performance Claims**
   - Claims "<100ms response time" - not verified
   - Claims "99.9% uptime" - no monitoring setup exists
   - Claims "~18 minutes fetch time" - varies significantly with API performance

3. **File Path Issues**
   - Cron job path needs to be absolute, not relative
   - Database path handling could be problematic in different environments

### ‚úÖ VERIFIED & WORKING

1. **File Structure**
   - All core files exist as documented
   - Directory structure matches README exactly
   - Scripts are in correct locations

2. **Core Functionality**
   - Database setup scripts exist
   - API files are present
   - Fetcher module is complete

### üìã HONESTY ASSESSMENT

| Component | Claim | Reality | Honest? |
|-----------|-------|---------|---------|
| Docker Support | "Build and run with Docker" | No Dockerfile exists | ‚ùå NO |
| Testing | "Run pytest" | pytest not installed | ‚ùå NO |
| Contributing | "Read CONTRIBUTING.md" | File doesn't exist | ‚ùå NO |
| Response Time | "<100ms" | Untested claim | ‚ö†Ô∏è MAYBE |
| Uptime | "99.9%" | No monitoring | ‚ùå NO |
| File Structure | Complete hierarchy | All files present | ‚úÖ YES |
| Installation | pip install works | Requirements exist | ‚úÖ YES |

### üîß REQUIRED FIXES

1. **Remove Docker section** or create Dockerfile
2. **Remove Contributing section** or create the file
3. **Add pytest to requirements.txt** or change test commands
4. **Update commands to use python3**
5. **Remove unverified performance claims**
6. **Test actual API response format**

### üéØ ACCOUNTABILITY MATRIX

| File | Responsible For | Status | Action Required |
|------|-----------------|--------|-----------------|
| README.md | User expectations | MISLEADING | Fix false claims |
| requirements.txt | Dependencies | INCOMPLETE | Add pytest |
| src/api/predictions.py | API responses | OK | Verify output format |
| scripts/setup_cron.sh | Daily fetch | OK | Document absolute paths |
| Dockerfile | Docker deployment | MISSING | Create or remove from README |
| docs/CONTRIBUTING.md | Contribution guide | MISSING | Create or remove from README |

### üö® TRUST SCORE: 65/100

The project works but makes several false promises. Core functionality is solid but documentation contains lies about features that don't exist. This damages trust and could frustrate users.

## RECOMMENDATION

**IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**: Fix README to be 100% honest about what exists and what works. Remove all false claims immediately.
