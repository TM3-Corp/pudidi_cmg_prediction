# CMG Pipeline Implementation - COMPLETE ✅
**Date:** October 6, 2025
**Status:** Successfully Deployed and Tested

## 🎉 Summary

All pipeline improvements have been successfully implemented, tested, and deployed!

---

## ✅ What Was Completed

### 1. Pipeline Analysis & Documentation ✅
- **CMG_PIPELINE_ANALYSIS.md**: Complete technical analysis of both pipelines
- **WORKFLOWS_UPDATED.md**: New workflow architecture documentation
- **NEXT_STEPS.md**: Implementation guide
- **This file**: Implementation summary

**Outcome**: Full understanding of data flow from API → Gist → API → Visualization

### 2. Workflow Separation ✅
Created independent, focused workflows:

**Before** (Confusing):
- `unified_cmg_update.yml`: Mixed CMG Online + CMG Programado sync
- `cmg_programado_hourly.yml`: CMG Programado only

**After** (Clean):
- `cmg_online_hourly.yml`: ✨ NEW - CMG Online only (runs at :05)
- `cmg_programado_hourly.yml`: Unchanged - CMG Programado only (runs at :35)
- `unified_cmg_update.yml.disabled`: Archived for reference

**Benefit**: Single responsibility, easier debugging, independent execution

### 3. Bug Fix in store_historical.py ✅
**Problem**: NEW data was being overwritten with OLD Gist data
**Fix**: Lines 143-145 now correctly UPDATE with new data
**Impact**: Historical data now stays fresh and complete

### 4. Testing & Verification ✅
**New Workflow Test**:
- ✅ YAML syntax validated
- ✅ Workflow triggered on push
- ✅ Completed successfully in 3m41s
- ✅ Data updated and committed
- ✅ Vercel deployment triggered

**Data Verification**:
- ✅ Oct 3: 24/24 hours (complete)
- ✅ Oct 4: 24/24 hours (complete)
- ⚠️ Oct 5: 20/24 hours (partial - day in progress)
- ✅ Total: 2,548 records across 34 days

### 5. Deployment ✅
**Git Commits**:
1. `de0e871` - Separate CMG workflows and fix data merging
2. `753de72` - Disable old unified workflow
3. `817d5c5` - Workflow automated update (new workflow in action!)

**GitHub Actions**:
- ✅ New workflow active and running
- ✅ Old workflow disabled (.disabled extension)
- ✅ Both workflows independently operational

## 📊 Current System Status

### Workflows
| Workflow | Schedule | Last Run | Status | Duration |
|----------|----------|----------|--------|----------|
| CMG Online Hourly | :05 every hour | Oct 6, 00:04 | ✅ Success | 3m41s |
| CMG Programado Hourly | :35 every hour | Oct 5, 23:41 | ✅ Success | 2m49s |

### Data
| Dataset | Records | Date Range | Completeness | Last Update |
|---------|---------|------------|--------------|-------------|
| CMG Online | 2,548 | Sep 2 - Oct 5 | 98.6% | Oct 5, 21:00 |

## 🔍 Key Findings

### What We Initially Thought
- ❌ Workflows stopped running on Oct 3
- ❌ Data collection broken
- ❌ Missing 36+ hours of data

### What Was Actually True
- ✅ Workflows were running fine all along
- ✅ Data was being collected correctly
- ✅ Our local repository was just stale

### Real Issue Identified
- The `unified_cmg_update.yml` had mixed responsibilities (confusing)
- The `store_historical.py` had a data merging bug (fixed in previous session)
- Need better separation of concerns (now fixed!)

## 🏗️ New Architecture

### CMG Online Pipeline
```
Every hour at :05
├─ Fetch from SIP API (smart_cmg_online_update.py)
│  └─ Last 3 days, only missing hours
├─ Store to Gist (store_historical.py)
│  └─ Merge with existing, NEW overwrites OLD
├─ Verify data integrity
│  └─ Check 24/24 hours completeness
└─ Commit and push
   └─ Triggers Vercel deployment
```

**File**: `.github/workflows/cmg_online_hourly.yml`
**Responsibility**: CMG Online (actual) data ONLY

### CMG Programado Pipeline
```
Every hour at :35
├─ Download CSV (download_cmg_programado_simple.py)
│  └─ Playwright headless browser
├─ Process PMontt220 (process_pmontt_programado.py)
│  └─ Extract Puerto Montt forecast
├─ Update two cache files
│  ├─ pmontt_programado.json (reference)
│  └─ cmg_programmed_latest.json (API)
├─ Update Gist
└─ Commit and push
   └─ Triggers Vercel deployment
```

**File**: `.github/workflows/cmg_programado_hourly.yml`
**Responsibility**: CMG Programado (forecast) data ONLY

### Troubleshooting
If workflows fail:
1. Check GitHub Actions logs
