# Next Steps - CMG Pipeline Review Complete
**Date:** October 5, 2025
**Session:** Pipeline Review and Workflow Separation

## ✅ What We Completed

### 1. Complete Pipeline Analysis ✅
- Reviewed CMG Online pipeline (fetch → store → Gist → API → visualization)
- Reviewed CMG Programado pipeline (download → process → Gist → API → visualization)
- Identified data flow for both pipelines
- Documented in `CMG_PIPELINE_ANALYSIS.md`

### 2. Data Status Assessment ✅
- CMG Online: 2,380 records, Sept 2 - Oct 3
  - Oct 1-2: Complete (24/24 hours) ✅
  - Oct 3: Incomplete (12/24 hours) ⚠️
  - Oct 4-5: Missing (workflow stopped) ❌
- CMG Programado: 72 records, Oct 3-5
  - All dates complete ✅
  - Oct 5 has some 0.0 values (hours 9-18) ⚠️

### 3. Root Cause Identification ✅
**Critical Finding**: Workflows stopped running after Oct 3 ~12:00 PM
- Last CMG Online update: Oct 3, 12:22 PM
- Last CMG Programado update: Oct 3, 11:47 AM
- Missing: 36+ hours of CMG Online data

### 4. Workflow Architecture Fixed ✅
**Problem**: `unified_cmg_update.yml` had mixed responsibilities
- Handled CMG Online ✅
- ALSO synced CMG Programado ⚠️ (confusion!)

**Solution**: Created separate, independent workflows
- ✅ `cmg_online_hourly.yml` - ONLY CMG Online (runs at :05)
- ✅ `cmg_programado_hourly.yml` - Already good (runs at :35)

### 5. Documentation Created ✅
- `CMG_PIPELINE_ANALYSIS.md` - Complete pipeline review
- `WORKFLOWS_UPDATED.md` - New workflow architecture
- `NEXT_STEPS.md` - This file

## ⚠️ Critical Issues Remaining

### Issue #1: Workflows Not Running (CRITICAL)
**Status**: Not yet fixed
**Impact**: Missing 36+ hours of data
**Next Actions**:
1. Check GitHub Actions logs for failures
2. Verify CMG_GIST_TOKEN secret is valid
3. Check repository permissions
4. Manually trigger workflows to test

### Issue #2: Old Unified Workflow Active
**Status**: New workflow created, old one still active
**Impact**: Potential conflicts if both run
**Next Actions**:
1. Disable/rename `unified_cmg_update.yml`
2. Commit new `cmg_online_hourly.yml`
3. Push to main branch
4. Monitor for 24 hours

### Issue #3: Missing Data (Oct 3-5)
**Status**: Identified but not backfilled
**Impact**: Incomplete historical data
**Next Actions**:
1. Run `smart_cmg_online_update.py` locally
2. Or wait for workflows to catch up
3. Verify data completeness after backfill

## 🎯 Immediate Actions (Do Now)

### 1. Commit and Push New Workflow
```bash
cd pudidi_CMG_prediction_system/vercel_deploy
git add .github/workflows/cmg_online_hourly.yml
git add CMG_PIPELINE_ANALYSIS.md
git add WORKFLOWS_UPDATED.md
git add NEXT_STEPS.md
git commit -m "Separate CMG workflows: create independent CMG Online workflow

- Create cmg_online_hourly.yml (dedicated to CMG Online only)
- Runs hourly at :05 (separate from CMG Programado at :35)
- Single responsibility: fetch from SIP API, store to Gist
- Better error handling and verification
- Documented in CMG_PIPELINE_ANALYSIS.md and WORKFLOWS_UPDATED.md

Next: Disable old unified_cmg_update.yml to prevent conflicts"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Disable Old Unified Workflow
```bash
cd .github/workflows
mv unified_cmg_update.yml unified_cmg_update.yml.disabled
git add unified_cmg_update.yml.disabled
git commit -m "Disable old unified workflow (replaced by cmg_online_hourly.yml)"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Check GitHub Actions Status
- Go to: https://github.com/[your-username]/[repo]/actions
- Check workflow runs from Oct 3
- Look for error messages
- Verify secrets are set correctly

### 4. Manually Trigger Workflows
- Go to Actions → CMG Online Hourly Update → Run workflow
- Go to Actions → CMG Programado Hourly Update → Run workflow
- Monitor execution and check for errors

## 📅 Next 24 Hours

### Monitor Workflows
- [ ] Verify CMG Online workflow runs at :05 every hour
- [ ] Verify CMG Programado workflow runs at :35 every hour
- [ ] Check no conflicts between workflows
- [ ] Confirm data is being updated

### Verify Data Completeness
- [ ] Check Oct 3 gets completed (hours 12-23 added)
- [ ] Check Oct 4 data appears
- [ ] Check Oct 5 data appears
- [ ] Verify all dates show 24/24 hours

### Backfill if Needed
If workflows don't auto-fill missing data:
```bash
cd pudidi_CMG_prediction_system/vercel_deploy
python3 scripts/smart_cmg_online_update.py
# This will fetch missing hours for last 3 days
```

## 📊 Next Week

### Add Monitoring
1. Set up workflow failure notifications
   - Use GitHub Actions notifications
   - Email alerts on failure
   - Slack integration (optional)

2. Add data freshness checks
   - Alert if no update in > 3 hours
   - Dashboard showing last update time
   - Automated health checks

3. Implement 5PM forecast validation (from previous session)
   - Capture 5PM forecasts daily
   - Compare with actuals after 24h
   - Track forecast accuracy over time

### Improve Error Handling
1. Better retry logic for API failures
2. Graceful degradation if Gist unavailable
3. Data quality checks after each update

## 🤔 If Something Goes Wrong

### Workflows Still Not Running
1. Check GitHub Actions is enabled for repo
2. Verify branch protection rules
3. Check secrets are set: `CMG_GIST_TOKEN`
4. Try workflow_dispatch (manual trigger)
5. Check runner availability (GitHub status)

### Data Not Updating
1. Check workflow logs in GitHub Actions
2. Verify SIP API is accessible (test locally)
3. Check Gist update permissions
4. Verify git push succeeds in workflow

### API Not Serving Fresh Data
1. Check cache files exist in `data/cache/`
2. Verify Vercel deployment succeeded
3. Check cache_manager paths are correct
4. Test API endpoint directly

## 💡 Summary

**What We Fixed:**
- ✅ Identified workflow stopped running (Oct 3)
- ✅ Separated workflows for clarity
- ✅ Documented complete pipeline
- ✅ Created new CMG Online workflow

**What's Left:**
- ⏭️ Enable new workflow, disable old one
- ⏭️ Investigate why workflows stopped
- ⏭️ Backfill missing Oct 3-5 data
- ⏭️ Monitor for 24 hours

**Key Insight:**
The pipeline logic is CORRECT. The issue is operational - workflows stopped executing. Once we restart them with the new separated architecture, everything should work smoothly!

## 🎉 Ready to Deploy!

When you're ready:
1. Commit the new workflow
2. Disable the old one
3. Push to main
4. Manually trigger once to test
5. Monitor for 24 hours
