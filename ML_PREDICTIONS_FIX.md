# 🔧 ML Predictions Fix - Fresh Data

## Issue Identified
ML predictions were showing **September 6** dates because:
- ❌ The ML forecast script wasn't running hourly
- ❌ The script was using an outdated data file
- ❌ GitHub Actions workflow didn't include ML prediction generation

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated ML Forecast Script
**File:** `scripts/ml_hourly_forecast.py`
- Changed data source from `cmg_online_from_csv.json` (outdated)
- Now uses `cache/cmg_historical_latest.json` (✅ up to Oct 8, 15:00)

### 2. Updated GitHub Actions Workflow
**File:** `.github/workflows/cmg_online_hourly.yml`
- Added dependencies: `lightgbm`, `xgboost`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`
- Added new step: "Generate ML 24-hour forecast"
- Runs after CMG Online fetch, before Gist storage
- Updates commit message to mention ML predictions

### 3. Workflow Steps (Now)
```
Hourly at :05 past each hour:
1. Fetch CMG Online data from SIP API
2. 🆕 Generate ML 24-hour forecast (uses latest data)
3. Store to Gist
4. Verify data integrity
5. Commit and push (triggers Railway redeploy)
```

## 🚀 Generate Fresh Predictions NOW

### Option 1: Trigger GitHub Actions Manually (Fastest)

1. **Go to GitHub Actions:**
   ```
   https://github.com/TM3-Corp/pudidi_cmg_prediction/actions
   ```

2. **Click on "CMG Online Hourly Update" workflow**

3. **Click "Run workflow" button (top right)**
   - Branch: `main`
   - Click green "Run workflow" button

4. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for completion

5. **Check results:**
   - Fresh predictions will be in `data/ml_predictions/latest.json`
   - Railway will auto-redeploy
   - Dashboard will show predictions starting from **Oct 8, 16:00** (next hour after latest data)

### Option 2: Wait for Automatic Run

The workflow runs every hour at :05 (e.g., 16:05, 17:05, 18:05).

**Next run:** At the :05 of the current or next hour

---

## 📊 Expected Result

After the workflow runs, predictions will be:

**Before (Wrong):**
```
Base time: 2025-09-06 01:00:00
Predictions: Sep 6 02:00, Sep 6 03:00, ..., Sep 7 01:00
```

**After (Correct):** ✅
```
Base time: 2025-10-08 15:00:00
Predictions: Oct 8 16:00, Oct 8 17:00, ..., Oct 9 15:00
```

## 🧪 Testing After Fix

### 1. Check Railway API
```bash
curl https://pudidicmgprediction-production.up.railway.app/api/ml_forecast | python3 -m json.tool | head -30
```

Look for:
- `"base_datetime": "2025-10-08 15:00:00"` ✅
- `"generated_at": "2025-10-08 ..."` ✅
- Predictions starting from Oct 8, 16:00 ✅

### 2. Check Dashboard
```
https://pudidicmgprediction.vercel.app
```

The green dotted line should:
- ✅ Start from Oct 8, 16:00 (or current hour)
- ✅ Extend 24 hours into the future
- ✅ Show red markers for predicted zero-CMG hours

### 3. Check Vercel Logs
If predictions still don't show, check that Railway redeployed:
- Railway auto-deploys when GitHub pushes new data
- Vercel dashboard fetches from Railway API
- Both should update within ~5 minutes of workflow completion

---

## 🔄 Automatic Updates Going Forward

**From now on, every hour:**
1. GitHub Actions runs at :05
2. Fetches latest CMG Online data
3. 🆕 **Generates fresh ML predictions** (using latest data)
4. Commits to repository
5. Railway auto-deploys (gets new predictions)
6. Dashboard shows updated forecast

**Result:** Your ML predictions will always use the **latest available data** and predict the **next 24 hours** from that point.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Predictions still showing old dates

**Check workflow ran successfully:**
```
https://github.com/TM3-Corp/pudidi_cmg_prediction/actions
```

**Check latest commit:**
```bash
git log --oneline -1
# Should show: "🔄 CMG Online update + ML Predictions - ..."
```

**Check predictions file:**
```bash
cat data/ml_predictions/latest.json | python3 -m json.tool | head -20
# Look for "base_datetime" - should be recent
```

### Workflow fails

**Check GitHub Actions logs:**
- Go to: https://github.com/TM3-Corp/pudidi_cmg_prediction/actions
- Click on failed run
- Check "Generate ML 24-hour forecast" step

**Common issues:**
- Missing dependencies → Fixed ✅ (added to workflow)
- Missing data file → Fixed ✅ (using correct cache file)
- Model files not found → Check `models_24h/` directory exists

### Railway not updating

**Force Railway redeploy:**
```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "Force Railway redeploy"
git push origin main
```

Railway will automatically pull the latest `data/ml_predictions/latest.json` and serve it via the API.
