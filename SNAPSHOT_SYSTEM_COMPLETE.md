# 5PM CMG Programado Snapshot System - Implementation Complete ✅

**Date:** October 6, 2025
**Status:** Deployed and Ready

---

## 🎯 What Was Built

A complete system to capture daily snapshots of CMG Programado forecasts at 5PM for proper forecast validation.

### Why This Matters

**The Problem:**
- Your current system overwrites CMG Programado values hourly
- This means you only see the latest t+1 forecast (most accurate)
- But your plant decides generation at **5PM for next 24 hours**
- You need to validate against the **snapshot from 5PM** (t+1 to t+24)

**The Solution:**
- Capture complete forecast at 5PM daily
- Store timestamped snapshots
- Later compare these snapshots vs actual CMG Online
- Track how accuracy degrades from t+1 → t+24 hours

## 📦 What Was Implemented

### 1. **Snapshot Capture Script** ✅
**File:** `scripts/capture_5pm_cmg_snapshot.py`

**What it does:**
- Loads current CMG Programado from `data/cache/cmg_programmed_latest.json`
- Creates timestamped snapshot with ALL forecast hours available
- Stores to GitHub Gist for public access
- Falls back to local storage if Gist unavailable

**Data Structure:**
```json
{
  "snapshots": {
    "2025-10-06T17:00:00": {
      "snapshot_time": "2025-10-06T17:00:00-03:00",
      "captured_at": "2025-10-06 17:00 -03",
      "forecast_hours": {
        "2025-10-06T18:00:00": {
          "date": "2025-10-06",
          "hour": 18,
          "node": "PMontt220",
          "cmg_programmed": 5.5
        },
        "2025-10-06T19:00:00": { ... },
        ...
      },
      "metadata": {
        "total_hours": 72,
        "dates": ["2025-10-06", "2025-10-07", "2025-10-08"],
        "node": "PMontt220",
        "source": "CMG Programado Download"
      }
    }
  },
  "metadata": {
    "last_snapshot": "2025-10-06T17:00:00-03:00",
    "total_snapshots": 1,
    "snapshots_list": ["2025-10-06T17:00:00"],
    "purpose": "5PM daily snapshots for forecast validation (t+1 to t+24)"
  }
}
```

### 2. **GitHub Action Workflow** ✅
**File:** `.github/workflows/cmg_5pm_snapshot.yml`

**Schedule:** Daily at 5PM Chilean time (20:00 UTC)

**What it does:**
1. Runs `capture_5pm_cmg_snapshot.py`
2. Creates Gist on first run (saves ID)
3. Updates existing Gist on subsequent runs
4. Commits Gist ID to repository if created
5. Falls back to local storage if Gist fails

**Manual Trigger:** Available via GitHub Actions UI for testing

### 3. **Testing** ✅
**Test Results:**
```
✅ Script executed successfully
✅ Captured 72 forecast hours (Oct 6-8)
✅ Created proper snapshot structure
✅ Saved to local cache (no GitHub token in local env)
✅ Metadata generated correctly
```

**Test Snapshot:**
- Snapshot time: 2025-10-06 12:59 -03
- Forecast hours: 72
- Range: 2025-10-06T00:00 to 2025-10-08T23:00
- Horizons: t-13h to t+58h

## 🚀 What Happens Next

### Automatic Operation

1. **Today at 5PM:** First workflow run
   - Creates new Gist for snapshots
   - Captures first snapshot
   - Saves Gist ID to repository

2. **Daily at 5PM:** Subsequent runs
   - Updates existing Gist with new snapshot
   - Accumulates historical snapshots
   - No manual intervention needed

3. **After 7 Days:** Ready for validation
   - 7+ snapshots collected
   - Can start comparing forecast vs actual
   - Analyze accuracy by horizon (t+1, t+6, t+24)

### First Run Action Required

**IMPORTANT:** After the first workflow run at 5PM today, you need to:

1. Check the workflow run in GitHub Actions
2. Look for: "⚠️ Save this Gist ID as CMG_SNAPSHOT_GIST_ID secret!"
3. Copy the Gist ID
4. Add as GitHub Secret:
   - Go to: Repository Settings → Secrets → Actions
   - Add new secret: `CMG_SNAPSHOT_GIST_ID`
   - Value: The Gist ID from the first run

**Why?** This allows future runs to update the same Gist instead of creating new ones.

## 📊 Future Validation (After 7 Days)

Once you have 7+ days of snapshots, you can:

### 1. Compare Specific Days
Pick a day and compare the 5PM forecast vs actual:
```
Oct 6 at 5PM forecast:
  Hour 18: $5.50 → Actual: $5.20 (error: -$0.30)
  Hour 19: $3.50 → Actual: $4.10 (error: +$0.60)
  Hour 20: $16.90 → Actual: $15.30 (error: -$1.60)
  ...
```

### 2. Analyze by Horizon
See how accuracy degrades:
```
t+1 hour:  MAE $3.20, RMSE $4.50 (most accurate)
t+6 hours: MAE $5.80, RMSE $7.80
t+24 hours: MAE $8.50, RMSE $12.10 (least accurate)
```

### 3. Identify Patterns
- Which hours are hardest to predict?
- Are mornings more accurate than evenings?
- Does accuracy vary by day of week?

## 🗂️ Data Storage

### Gist (Production)
- **URL:** Will be created on first run (check workflow output)
- **Public:** Yes (read-only for API access)
- **Updates:** Daily at 5PM
- **Retention:** Unlimited (Gist history tracks changes)

### Local Backup
- **File:** `data/cache/cmg_programado_snapshots.json`
- **Purpose:** Fallback if Gist unavailable
- **Committed:** Only if Gist fails

## 🔍 Monitoring

### Check Workflow Status
```bash
gh run list --workflow=cmg_5pm_snapshot.yml --limit 5
```

### View Latest Snapshot
```bash
# After first run, check the Gist ID
cat .cmg_snapshot_gist_id

# View Gist content (replace GIST_ID)
gh gist view GIST_ID
```

### Manual Test
```bash
# Trigger workflow manually
gh workflow run cmg_5pm_snapshot.yml

# Or run script locally
python3 scripts/capture_5pm_cmg_snapshot.py
```

## 🎓 Key Insights

### Storage Approach
- **Started with:** Gist (simple, public, no cost)
- **Future consideration:** If snapshots grow too large (>100MB), migrate to S3 or database
- **Current estimate:** ~1 snapshot/day × 72 hours × 100 bytes = ~7KB/day = ~2.5MB/year ✅ Gist is fine

### Data Quality
- Each snapshot is **timestamped** (when forecast was made)
- Each forecast hour is **timestamped** (what time it forecasts)
- This allows proper **forecast horizon analysis** (t+1, t+6, t+24)

### Validation Use Case
Perfect for your 5PM SCADA optimization:
1. **5PM Decision Point:** "What generation should I set for next 24 hours?"
2. **Use Snapshot:** CMG Programado forecast from 5PM
3. **Next Day:** Compare snapshot vs actual CMG Online
4. **Learn:** Which horizons are reliable? Where to add safety margins?

## 📞 Next Steps

1. **Wait for 5PM:** First workflow run happens automatically
2. **Save Gist ID:** Add to GitHub Secrets after first run
3. **Monitor:** Check workflow runs daily
4. **After 7 days:** Start validation analysis
